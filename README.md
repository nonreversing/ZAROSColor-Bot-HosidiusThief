# ZAROSColor-Bot-HosidiusThief
Absolutely bog standard Hosidius stall thieving script. 

Add "from .hosidiusthief import ZarosHosidiusThief" to your init.py file in the ./src/model/zaros folder.
Add the "src/images/bot/items" folder to your main OSRS Color Bot folder and overwrite.
Move to the location indicated in the photo and tag both stalls.
Make sure your inventory is mostly empty -- it won't drop anything besides what the stall might give as loot.
